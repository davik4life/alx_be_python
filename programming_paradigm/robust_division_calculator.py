"""
    Task Description:
Create two Python scripts: robust_division_calculator.py, which contains the division logic including error handling, and main.py, which interfaces with the user through the command line.

robust_division_calculator.py:
Define a function safe_divide(numerator, denominator) that performs division, handling potential errors:

Division by Zero: Use a try-except block to catch ZeroDivisionError.
Non-numeric Input: Attempt to convert arguments to floats. Use a try-except block to catch ValueError for non-numeric inputs.
Return appropriate messages for errors or the result for successful division.
main.py for Command Line Interaction:
This script will import safe_divide from robust_division_calculator.py and use it to divide numbers provided as command line arguments.
